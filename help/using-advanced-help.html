<p>The <em>Advanced help</em> system is a pluggable system that provides
  advanced help facilities for Drupal and its modules and themes. Although the
  advanced help does not provide general help by itself, it provides a powerful
  and easy framework that modules and themes may use to provide their own help.
  </p>

<h2 id="access-control">Access control</h2>

<p>When this module is installed, users with the
<code>view advanced help index</code>
permission can access the advanced help index by going to
<em>Administer &rarr; Advanced Help</em>
(<code>admin/advanced_help</code>). Additional permissions
<code>view advanced help topic</code>  and
<code>view advanced help popup</code>
enable users to access the actual help pages and popups.</p>



<p>Modules and themes utilizing <em>Advanced help</em> should create a 'help'
  subdirectory inside their own main directory. Place the file
  MODULENAME.help.ini (resp. THEMENAME.help.ini) in this subdirectory, formatted
  similar to the following example:</p>

<pre>
[buses]
title = "How buses are tied into the system"
file = buses

[TOPIC_ID]
title = "Title of topic".
file = filename of topic, without the .html extension.
weight = How important the topic is on the index page.
parent = The optional topic parent to use in the breadcrumb,
         either topic or module%topic.
</pre>

<p>All topics are addressed by the module or theme providing the topic, and by
  the topic id. To embed links, use the following format:</p>

<code>$output .= theme('advanced_help_topic', $module, $topic);</code>

<p>Inside your help file, link to other topics using the format
  <strong>&lt;a href="&amp;topic:module/topic&amp;"&gt;</strong>. This format
  will ensure the popup status remains consistent when switching between links.
  </p>

<p>Use <strong>&lt;a href="&amp;path&amp;example.jpg"&gt;</strong> to reference
  items within the help directory, such as images you wish to embed within the
  help text.</p>

<p>Use <strong>&lt;a href="&amp;base_url&amp;admin/settings/site-configuration"&gt;</strong>
  to reference any normal path in the site.</p>

<p>If the search module is enabled, the contents of help system will be indexed
  on cron. If you enable new modules or themes and wish to immediately index
  their help text, visit the "Administration -> Reports -> Status report" and
  click the "Run cron manually" link.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="&path&nowhere.jpg">Don't click this!</a></p>

<p>See: <a href="&topic:advanced_help/ini-file&">ini file format</a></p>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong> In previous versions Advanced Help did not require
  the &amp;'s wrapped around the topic:, path:, and base_url: links.  This is
  currently still supported, but may be removed in a future version.  By adding
  the &amp;'s these tokens are now not limited to href="" and src=""
  parameters.</p>
